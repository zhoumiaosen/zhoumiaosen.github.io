## Miaosen Zhou

Hello! I'm currently an Accelerated MASc Student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (Formerly: Ryerson University) and a researcher in the Signal and Information Processing (SIP) Laboratory under Dr. Beheshtiâ€™s supervision who has an MIT background. My research interest and passion lies in Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. I would like to continue my research in Machine Learning especially in combination with Quantum Computing, as I think both Machine Learning and Quantum Computing are important parts of human progress. I am applying for Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering PhD programs, and I expect to graduate in Summer 2023. Please reach out to me if you're looking for PhD students.
